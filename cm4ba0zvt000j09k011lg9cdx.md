Stack-based attacks have been a persistent threat in software development, primarily because the stack's predictable behavior makes it a prime target for exploitation. Attackers often manipulate stack memory to execute malicious code, disrupt program flow, or gain unauthorized access to systems. As a response, compiler developers have introduced numerous countermeasures to safeguard against these vulnerabilities.

This blog explores stack-based attacks, focusing on how GCC and Clang compilers mitigate these threats through an extensive array of tools and flags.

## **What Are Stack-Based Attacks?**

The stack is a memory structure used by programs to manage function calls, local variables, and control flow. A stack-based attack typically occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, to overwrite critical stack data. By tampering with return addresses or other sensitive values, attackers can hijack program execution.

### **Why Are Stack Attacks Dangerous?**

1. **Predictability:** The stack layout follows a consistent structure, making it easier for attackers to guess its arrangement.
    
2. **Low Cost:** Attacks like buffer overflows require minimal resources.
    
3. **High Impact:** Once successful, attackers can execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges.

## **Defensive Mechanisms in GCC and Clang**

Modern compilers employ several defenses to counter stack-based attacks. Below are the most prominent mechanisms:

---

### **1\. Stack Canaries**

Stack canaries act as sentinels guarding the stack. A *canary* value is placed in memory adjacent to return addresses. Before a function returns, the compiler checks the canary value. If it has been altered, the program terminates, signaling a potential attack.

#### **How It Works:**

* At runtime, a random or deterministic value is stored as the canary.
    
* Before exiting a function, the program verifies the canary's integrity.
    
* If tampered with, a security response (e.g., termination) is triggered.
    

#### **Compiler Flags:**

* `-fstack-protector`: Adds canaries to functions containing certain vulnerable objects.
    
* `-fstack-protector-strong`: Protects more functions by extending coverage to those using arrays, references, or local variables.
    
* `-fstack-protector-all`: Applies canaries to every function.
    
* `-fstack-protector-explicit`: Adds canaries based on user annotations.
    

#### **Strengths and Weaknesses:**

* **Strength:** Effective for common buffer overflow scenarios.
    
* **Weakness:** Attackers can still bypass this mechanism with sophisticated techniques, such as return-oriented programming (ROP).

### **2\. SafeStack and Shadow Stack**

To minimize the risk of stack smashing, some approaches separate sensitive data from user-controlled data:

#### **SafeStack:**

Separates the stack into two areas:

* **Safe Stack:** Stores critical control data like return addresses.
    
* **Unsafe Stack:** Contains user-controlled data and local variables.
    

**Compiler Flag:** `-fsanitize=safe-stack` (Clang)

#### **Shadow Stack:**

Creates a secure duplicate of the control stack in hardware or software. This ensures that even if one stack is compromised, the other remains intact.

**Compiler Flag:** `-mshstk` (GCC/Clang, hardware-dependent)

#### **Strengths:**

* Protects critical data from being overwritten by malicious inputs.
    
* Makes it harder for attackers to execute control flow hijacking.
    

#### **Weaknesses:**

* May increase memory and performance overhead.
    

---

### **3\. Fortified Source**

The GNU C Library (`glibc`) provides enhanced versions of standard functions (e.g., `memcpy`, `strcpy`) to add bounds-checking during runtime. This mechanism ensures that memory operations do not exceed predefined limits.

#### **Compiler Flags:**

* `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=<n>`: Enables fortified versions of standard functions.
    
    * `<n>` ranges from 1 to 3, with higher levels offering stricter checks.
        
* Requires optimization level `> -O0`.
    

#### **Strengths:**

* Prevents common memory-related vulnerabilities.
    
* Transparent to developers for standard-compliant code.
    

#### **Weaknesses:**

* Strict bounds-checking may cause compliant programs to fail.
    
* Higher levels can slightly impact performance.
    

---

### **4\. Control Flow Integrity (CFI)**

CFI prevents attackers from hijacking control flow by validating the legitimacy of jump and return addresses. It is particularly effective against ROP attacks.

#### **Compiler Flags:**

* `-fcf-protection=[full]`: Supports Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).
    
* `-mbranch-protection=<options>`: Adds branch target protection on AArch64 architectures.
    
* `-fsanitize=cfi`: Implements software-based CFI checks (Clang).
    

#### **Strengths:**

* Robust against advanced attacks like ROP.
    
* Leverages hardware features for efficiency (where available).
    

#### **Weaknesses:**

* Requires compatible hardware or incurs software overhead.
    

---

### **5\. Stack Allocation Control**

#### **Dynamic Stack Allocation:**

Compilers can split the stack into discontiguous segments to handle stack exhaustion gracefully.

**Compiler Flag:** `-fsplit-stack`

#### **Stack Limits:**

Enforces stack usage limits to prevent overflows.

**Compiler Flags:**

* `-fstack-limit-register`
    
* `-fstack-limit-symbol`
    

#### **Disabling Stack Arrays:**

Prevents the use of stack-allocated arrays, which are frequent targets for attacks.

**Compiler Flag:** `-fno-stack-array`

---

### **6\. Stack Usage Monitoring**

Dynamic stack allocations (e.g., `alloca()` and variable-length arrays or VLAs) are vulnerable to attacks if improperly managed. GCC and Clang provide tools to warn developers about risky stack usage.

#### **Flags for Monitoring:**

* `-Wframe-larger-than`: Warns about large stack frames.
    
* `-Walloca`, `-Walloca-larger-than`: Tracks and limits `alloca()` usage.
    
* `-Wvla`, `-Wvla-larger-than`: Warns about VLA usage.
    

#### **Strengths:**

* Helps developers optimize stack usage.
    
* Reduces the attack surface by flagging dangerous patterns.
    

#### **Weaknesses:**

* Does not directly prevent attacks; serves as a diagnostic tool.

## **Combining Tools for Comprehensive Defense**

To protect against stack-based attacks effectively, developers can combine several compiler flags:

* Use **stack canaries** (`-fstack-protector-strong`) for basic protection.
    
* Enable **SafeStack** (`-fsanitize=safe-stack`) for additional isolation.
    
* Activate **FORTIFY\_SOURCE** (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`) to enhance memory safety.
    
* Implement **CFI** (`-fsanitize=cfi` or `-fcf-protection`) for control flow validation.
    
* Regularly monitor stack usage (`-Wstack-usage`, `-Wframe-larger-than`) during development.

## **Tradeoffs**

While these mechanisms improve security, they may introduce tradeoffs:

1. **Performance:** Some flags add runtime overhead.
    
2. **Compatibility:** Strict checks may break legacy or non-standard code.
    
3. **Code Size:** Additional security metadata increases binary size.
    

---

## **Conclusion**

Stack-based attacks remain a critical challenge, but modern compilers like GCC and Clang offer powerful defenses. By leveraging these tools, developers can build more secure applications without significantly compromising performance. Selecting the right combination of flags requires balancing security needs with practical constraints, making it essential to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Embracing these compiler-based protections is a key step toward building resilient systems in an increasingly threat-prone digital world.
