### Basic Usage

**Installing ClamAV**: You can install ClamAV on your system using your operating system's package manager. For example, on Fedora, you can use the following command to install ClamAV:

**Updating ClamAV:** Before running a scan, it's essential to update the ClamAV database to the latest version. To update ClamAV, use the following command:

**Remove infected files:** By default, ClamAV only reports infected files without taking any action. To remove infected files, you can use the below command:

```plaintext
sudo clamscan -r --remove /
```

This will scan your entire system and delete any infected files that are found.

**Schedule Regular Scans:** To ensure that your system is consistently protected, you can set up regular scans using the "*crontab*" utility. For instance, you can schedule a weekly scan of your entire system by running the following command:

```plaintext
0 0  0 sudo clamscan -r /

which will initiate a scan every Sunday at midnight. You may adjust the command based on your preferred scan frequency and timing.
