[Fedora](http://getfedora.org/) Linux is a popular operating system that offers robust security features to protect users’ systems from threats. However, there are always additional steps that you can take to strengthen security further. In this blog, we will discuss ten tips to strengthen security in Fedora Linux.

1. **Keep your system up-to-date:** Always keep your Fedora Linux system up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. Fedora frequently releases updates that address security vulnerabilities.
    
2. **Enable SELinux:** SELinux is a security feature in Fedora that provides an additional layer of protection by enforcing mandatory access controls. Enable SELinux to restrict user and application access and prevent unauthorized system changes.
    
3. **Use a firewall:** Fedora Linux includes a firewall that you can configure to limit network access to your system. Configure the firewall to block unnecessary incoming traffic and allow only essential services.
    
4. **Use strong passwords:** Use strong passwords for all user accounts and change them regularly. Weak passwords can be easily cracked, leaving your system vulnerable to attacks.
    
5. **Limit user access:** Limit user access to only the resources and applications they need to perform their job functions. This can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    
6. **Disable unnecessary services:** Disable unnecessary services and applications that you don’t need. This can reduce your system’s attack surface and minimize the risk of security issues.
    
7. **Use encryption:** Use encryption to protect sensitive data and communication. Encryption can prevent unauthorized access to your data and ensure confidentiality.
    
8. **Enable automatic updates:** Enable automatic updates to ensure that your system is always up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. This can prevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities.
    
9. **Scan for malware:** Use antivirus software to scan your system for malware regularly. Malware can compromise your system’s security and put your data at risk.
    
10. **Monitor logs:** Monitor system logs to identify unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and potential vulnerabilities. Logs can provide valuable information about system activities and help you identify security issues.
